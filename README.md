# PvPRUN - Minecraft 1.21.5

PvPRUN is a multiplayer game in which players compete against each other in a race while being able to attack one another. The goal is to run as many blocks as possible in one direction. The game ends either when only one player remains alive – who then automatically wins – or when the set time runs out, in which case the player who has covered the greatest distance wins.
